  Litvinenko Inquiry 3.160

An episode from november-december 2006. EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests.
There is an inconsistency between the assertion made by the Russian authorities on 1 December 2006 that both planes had been tested and found to be clean, and the documents received in 2013 suggesting that the results of the Russian esting of one of the planes had been positive.
DI Mascall stated in evidence that these documents had never been formally provided to the Metropolitan Police Service, and that he saw them for the first time in 2013.
