There was the evidence of the two pathologists, Dr Cary and Dr Swift, who conducted Mr Litvinenko’s post mortem at the Royal London Hospital on 1 December 2006. Special safety precautions were taken because of the radioactivity that was then still present in Mr Litvinenko’s body. Even so, Dr Cary stated that the procedure had been: “one of the most dangerous postmortem examinations ever undertaken in the Western world”.

## Curious incident. EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests
An episode from november-december 2006 - EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests.

There is an inconsistency between the assertion made by the Russian authorities on 1 December 2006 that both planes had been tested and found to be clean, and the documents received in 2013 suggesting that the results of the Russian esting of one of the planes had been positive.
DI Mascall stated in evidence that these documents had never been formally provided to the Metropolitan Police Service, and that he saw them for the first time in 2013.
