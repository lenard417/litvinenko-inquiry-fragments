There was the evidence of the two pathologists, Dr Cary and Dr Swift, who conducted Mr Litvinenko’s post mortem at the Royal London Hospital on 1 December 2006. Special safety precautions were taken because of the radioactivity that was then still present in Mr Litvinenko’s body. Even so, Dr Cary stated that the procedure had been: “one of the most dangerous postmortem examinations ever undertaken in the Western world”.

## Curious incident. EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests
An episode from november-december 2006 - EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests.

On 1 December 2006, an official at the British Embassy in Moscow named Mr Knott notified both the Russian authorities and Transaero of the concern as to possible contamination of the aircraft, and of the advice that they should be tested before they next flew. On the same day, Mr Knott was informed both by officials in the office of Mr Gennadiy Onishchenko, the then Russian Chief Public Health Officer, and by Mr Alexander Tarrenets, the Deputy Director of Security for Transaero, that Mascall both planes had in fact already been tested and that no contamination had been found.


In fact, aircraft **EI-DNM** flew into Heathrow on that day, 1 December 2006, and was tested for contamination by **AWE** scientists. They discovered **secondary alpha radiation** contamination in the area of the seats on which Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoy had sat on the flight on 18 October.


**EI-DDK** was in fact scheduled to fly to London on the next day, 2 December. That flight, however, was cancelled. Transaero explained at the time that the cancellation was due to disruption to their scheduling caused by the testing of **EI-DNM** in London.


It appears that **EI-DDK** did not in fact return to the UK for some time after that, and that it was **never** tested by UK authorities.


There is an inconsistency between the assertion made by the Russian authorities on 1 December 2006 that both planes had been tested and found to be clean, and the documents received in 2013 suggesting that the results of the **Russian testing of one of the planes had been positive**.
**DI Mascall stated in evidence** that these documents had **never been formally provided** to the Metropolitan Police Service, and that he **saw them for the first time in 2013**.


There is also a conflict between the initial assertion by the Russians that EI-DNM was **not** contaminated, and the outcome of the tests conducted on that aircraft by **AWE**. Moreover, the delay of seven years in the production of the Russian test results remains unexplained. In the circumstances, I do not consider that any weight can be placed on what the Russian authorities have said about the testing of either of these aircraft, in particular the assertion that **EI-DDK** was tested and found to be clean.

## Main crime scene - Millennium Hotel Pine Bar
CCTV footage at the Millennium Hotel shows Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun arriving back there at about 3.30pm. Similar footage shows Mr Litvinenko arriving at the hotel at about 4.00pm - evidence for a meeting that took place in the Pine Bar of the hotel between Mr Lugovoy, Mr Kovtun and Mr Litvinenko.

"There was a cup I poured some tea out of the tea pot, although there was only little left on the bottom  and it made just half a cup. Maybe about 50 grams. I swallowed a several times but it was green tea with no sugar and it was already cold by the way. I didn’t like  it for some reason, well almost cold tea with no sugar and I didn’t drink it anymore.  Maybe in total I swallowed three or four times, I haven’t even finished that cup."

)

The other place where primary contamination was found was on one of the Pine Bar’s white teapots. The teapot had been given the exhibit number NJH/1. A1 gave evidence that every teapot in the hotel had been tested, and that NJH/1 had been the only one that bore evidence of contamination. The readings were **extremely high**. The highest readings were taken on the inside of the spout, where the polonium appeared to have bonded with tannin deposits. A1 stated that the levels and position of the contamination found on the inside of the teapot indicated that, “at some stage polonium… has been poured out of the spout”. She was sure of this. She said, “I think that’s the only conclusion you can come to.”


A1 also drew attention to the readings taken in the gentlemen’s lavatories situated next to the reception area at the Millennium Hotel. It will be recalled that the evidence of the CCTV footage was that these lavatories had been used by both Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun shortly before the Pine Bar meeting, but not by Mr Litvinenko at any point. Testing showed raised readings on one cubicle door, a sink and a hand drier. A1 expressed the view that the contamination was secondary rather than primary, albeit that, relatively speaking, the secondary contamination was at “very, very high levels”


The forensic evidence shows that the Pine Bar was heavily contaminated with polonium 210. The contamination was focused on thetable where Mr Litvinenko sat with Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun on 1 November 2006. The highest readings, which were consistentwith primary contamination, were taken on the table itself and on the inside of one of the teapots used in the Pine Bar. A1’s evidence was that the readings on the inside of the teapot demonstrated that, “at some stage polonium… has been poured out of the spout”. She said she was sure of this (see paragraph 6.322).
No comparable levels of contamination were found in any of the other places that Mr Litvinenko visited that day.

Professor Dombey estimated that at least 50 micrograms of polonium 210 was put into the teapot at the Millennium Hotel on the afternoon of 1 November 2006. His reasoning was that the 4.4GBq that Mr Litvinenko was considered to have ingested equated to 26.5 micrograms, and the higher figure of 50 micrograms was chosen as a conservative estimate to allow for the extra polonium 210 that had been in the teapot but which Mr Litvinenko had not ingested, i.e. the polonium 210 mixed with the unpoured tea in the pot and the undrunk tea in the cup.

)

Neither Mr Lugovoy nor, in the end, Mr Kovtun, gave oral evidence to the Inquiry. However, both have made public statements concerning the case since 2006 and Mr Kovtun provided the Inquiry with a witness statement.
Mr Kovtun told a German newspaper in December 2006 (i.e. a few weeks after the meeting in the Pine Bar) that he did not have a clear memory of the meeting and that at the time he had paid more attention to his cigar. More than eight years later, the statement that he provided to the Inquiry contained a detailed account of the meeting, including an assertion that Mr Litvinenko “grabbed the teapot on the table and, without waiting for an invitation, poured himself some tea” and that he “gulped down two cups of hot tea one after the other … [and] then had a coughing fit” (see paragraphs 6.318 – 6.319). There is no reason at all to think that Mr Kovtun’s memory had improved dramatically so many years after the event. The only logical conclusion is that he was lying on one or other (or both) of the two occasions.
The deficiencies in the accounts that have been provided by Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun, of which the matters set out above are only examples, lead to two conclusions. First,I do not regard the evidence that the two men have given about these events as credible, and I will not accept any part of their accounts in the absence of corroboration from a reliable source of evidence. Second, and more importantly, I make a positive finding that **both men have deliberately attempted to mislead** the recipients of the various accounts they have given regarding crucial issues in the case. I infer that they have done so in order to conceal their own actions. These findings support my **overall conclusion that Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun poisoned** Mr Litvinenko.

## Scenes of contamination aka the polonium trail

Various sites were identified as having been contaminated in the days and weeks following Mr Litvinenko’s death – hotel rooms, restaurants, aircraft, offices. Detective Inspector (DI) Mascall said that the task that faced the police and the forensic scientists in this respect was unprecedented, certainly in the United Kingdom (UK). In the course of his evidence he explained the system of sequential testing that was adopted involving the police, scientists from the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) and scientists from the Health Protection Agency (HPA).

Forensic scientists were sent to conduct tests for alpha radiation at a series of locations across London and, subsequently, **beyond**. The results demonstrated widespread radioactive contamination at locations that had been linked to Mr Lugovoy, Mr Kovtun and Mr Litvinenko in a **period** of a little over two weeks from mid October until the onset of Mr Litvinenko’s fatal illness in early November.


I shall refer not only to the extensive witness and documentary evidence that has been adduced, but also to the body of evidence arising from the testing for radioactive contamination – the evidence that has become popularly known as **‘the
polonium trail’**.


To obtain forensic evidence of the contamination for the purposes of their investigation. Detective Inspector (DI) Mascall said that the task that faced the police and the forensic scientists in this respect was unprecedented, certainly in the United Kingdom (UK). In the course of his evidence he explained the system of sequential testing that was adopted involving the police, scientists from the **Atomic Weapons** Establishment (AWE) and scientists from the Health Protection Agency (HPA).


At some point during the afternoon of 16 October 2006, a meeting took place between Mr Lugovoy, Mr Kovtun, Mr Litvinenko and Mr Reilly. The meeting was held at Mr Reilly’s offices at 25 Grosvenor Street, London. Evidence of extensive polonium contamination of the boardroom that was discovered after Mr Litvinenko’s death.

On october 16, Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun spent the evening having dinner with Dr Shadrin at the Pescatori restaurant in Dover Street. Then they went on to a bar near the Best Western Hotel named Dar Marrakesh, where a bill was paid with the same credit card at 11.05pm. The bill was for £9.00, which appeared to reflect the purchase of a shisha pipe.


The Pescatori restaurant and Dar Marrakesh were both found to have secondary contamination. At the Pescatori, the table with the highest level of contamination was table 17. At Dar Marrakesh, one of the shisha pipes was found to be contaminated.


Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun spent the night at the Best Western Hotel. As I have already said, Mr Lugovoy had room 107. Mr Kovtun’s room, which had not been available earlier, was room 308. As we shall see, this was in fact the only night that the two men spent at the Best Western Hotel.


Both rooms were subsequently tested and were found to contain extensive contamination. Room 107 was more heavily contaminated than room 308. A1 gave her opinion as to the interpretation of the readings taken in these two rooms. She said that the most significant result of this testing was the discovery of what she judged to be primary contamination in the u-bend of the sink in the bathroom of room 107. She explained that the scientists had opened the **u-bend** and found the contamination on detritus such as hair, etc. caught in the u-bend. The testing of the room had taken place on 22 December – **more than two months after** Mr Lugovoy had stayed in it. A1 said that the repeated use of the sink that would have taken place during that period explained the fact that relatively low readings were taken in the area of the sink itself – from where the polonium would have been washed away – in contrast to the sediment in the u-bend, where the polonium would have been caught. She added that even in the u-bend the initial levels of contamination may have been considerably higher. In a nutshell, A1’s view was that the contamination in the u-bend was consistent with **polonium being poured down the sink plughole**.


On October 17, Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun went to The Golden Dragon restaurant, Cafe Boheme and Hey Jo nightclub. They were all tested for alpha radiation. No contamination was found at the Golden Dragon or at Cafe Boheme. Secondary contamination was, however, found at Hey Jo nightclub.


They arrived at Mr Berezovsky’s offices on October 31 - November 1st. Secondary contamination was found in a number of places. One such place was the photocopier that Mr Litvinenko used when he visited the offices after meeting Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun at the Pine Bar on 1 November 2006. The highest readings, however, were taken from ‘sofa 1’, the sofa on which Mr Lugovoy had been sitting at his meeting with Mr Berezovsky.

Mr Lugovoy occupied room 848 at the Sheraton for the nights of 25, 26 and 27 October 2006. DI Mascall gave evidence about the radioactive contamination found in the hotel. He said that the readings taken there were the **highest found** in the entire investigation.

In contrast to the Best Western, however, the readings taken in the bathroom sink and in the disposal pipe from the sink were not especially high. Rather, the highest readings in room 848 were found in the bathroom bin, in particular on one area of the base of the plastic inner casing of the bin. A1 was very confident that these readings were evidence of primary contamination. The other notable feature of the pattern of contamination at the Sheraton Hotel was the contamination found in the hotel laundry. Two towels found in the laundry also gave such high radiation readings that A1 considered them to be consistent with primary contamination. In their closing submissions, Mr Horwell QC and Mr Emmerson QC suggested that the pattern of contamination was consistent with an accidental spillage, perhaps followed by an attempt to clean up and/or dispose of the solution.


The German authorities conducted widespread tests for radiation in **Hamburg** following Mr Litvinenko’s death. Secondary contamination was discovered in many of the places that Mr Kovtun had visited during his brief stay (28 October - 1 November).
Secondary contamination was found in Marina Wall’s flat, where Mr Kovtun had spent his first and last night in Hamburg, and also in the BMW car in which she had picked him up from the airport.Secondary contamination was also found in Elenora Wall’s house. No contamination was found at the Aliens’ Registration Office, although a slightly raised reading was taken under the passport photograph in Mr Kovtun’s passport.Secondary contamination was also found on the bed in D3’s flat, where Mr Kovtun had spent the night of Monday 30 October.
