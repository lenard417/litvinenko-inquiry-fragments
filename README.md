## Cause of death
Dr Harrison stated that the best estimate of intake (primary cause of death) was 4.4Gbq of polonium 210.

There was the evidence of the two pathologists, Dr Cary and Dr Swift, who conducted Mr Litvinenko’s post mortem at the Royal London Hospital on 1 December 2006. Special safety precautions were taken because of the radioactivity that was then still present in Mr Litvinenko’s body. Even so, Dr Cary stated that the procedure had been: “one of the most dangerous postmortem examinations ever undertaken in the Western world”.

## Curious incident. EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests
An episode from november-december 2006 - EI-DNM aircraft contamination tests.

On 1 December 2006, an official at the British Embassy in Moscow named Mr Knott notified both the Russian authorities and Transaero of the concern as to possible contamination of the aircraft, and of the advice that they should be tested before they next flew. On the same day, Mr Knott was informed both by officials in the office of Mr Gennadiy Onishchenko, the then Russian Chief Public Health Officer, and by Mr Alexander Tarrenets, the Deputy Director of Security for Transaero, that Mascall both planes had in fact already been tested and that no contamination had been found.


In fact, aircraft **EI-DNM** flew into Heathrow on that day, 1 December 2006, and was tested for contamination by **AWE** scientists. They discovered **secondary alpha radiation** contamination in the area of the seats on which Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoy had sat on the flight on 18 October.

**EI-DDK** was in fact scheduled to fly to London on the next day, 2 December. That flight, however, was cancelled. Transaero explained at the time that the cancellation was due to disruption to their scheduling caused by the testing of **EI-DNM** in London.

It appears that **EI-DDK** did not in fact return to the UK for some time after that, and that it was **never** tested by UK authorities.

There is an inconsistency between the assertion made by the Russian authorities on 1 December 2006 that both planes had been tested and found to be clean, and the documents received in 2013 suggesting that the results of the **Russian testing of one of the planes had been positive**.
**DI Mascall stated in evidence** that these documents had **never been formally provided** to the Metropolitan Police Service, and that he **saw them for the first time in 2013**.

There is also a conflict between the initial assertion by the Russians that EI-DNM was **not** contaminated, and the outcome of the tests conducted on that aircraft by **AWE**. Moreover, the delay of seven years in the production of the Russian test results remains unexplained. In the circumstances, I do not consider that any weight can be placed on what the Russian authorities have said about the testing of either of these aircraft, in particular the assertion that **EI-DDK** was tested and found to be clean.

## Main crime scene - Millennium Hotel Pine Bar
CCTV footage at the Millennium Hotel shows Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun arriving back there at about 3.30pm. Similar footage shows Mr Litvinenko arriving at the hotel at about 4.00pm - evidence for a meeting that took place in the Pine Bar of the hotel between Mr Lugovoy, Mr Kovtun and Mr Litvinenko.

There was a cup I poured some tea out of the tea pot, although there was only little left on the bottom  and it made just half a cup. Maybe about 50 grams. I swallowed a several times but it was green tea with no sugar and it was already cold by the way. I didn’t like  it for some reason, well almost cold tea with no sugar and I didn’t drink it anymore.  Maybe in total I swallowed three or four times, I haven’t even finished that cup.

)

The other place where primary contamination was found was on one of the Pine Bar’s white teapots. The teapot had been given the exhibit number NJH/1. A1 gave evidence that every teapot in the hotel had been tested, and that NJH/1 had been the only one that bore evidence of contamination. The readings were **extremely high**. The highest readings were taken on the inside of the spout, where the polonium appeared to have bonded with tannin deposits. A1 stated that the levels and position of the contamination found on the inside of the teapot indicated that, “at some stage polonium… has been poured out of the spout”. She was sure of this. She said, “I think that’s the only conclusion you can come to.”


A1 also drew attention to the readings taken in the gentlemen’s lavatories situated next to the reception area at the Millennium Hotel. It will be recalled that the evidence of the CCTV footage was that these lavatories had been used by both Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun shortly before the Pine Bar meeting, but not by Mr Litvinenko at any point. Testing showed raised readings on one cubicle door, a sink and a hand drier. A1 expressed the view that the contamination was secondary rather than primary, albeit that, relatively speaking, the secondary contamination was at “very, very high levels”


The forensic evidence shows that the Pine Bar was heavily contaminated with polonium 210. The contamination was focused on thetable where Mr Litvinenko sat with Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun on 1 November 2006. The highest readings, which were consistentwith primary contamination, were taken on the table itself and on the inside of one of the teapots used in the Pine Bar. A1’s evidence was that the readings on the inside of the teapot demonstrated that, “at some stage polonium… has been poured out of the spout”. She said she was sure of this (see paragraph 6.322).
No comparable levels of contamination were found in any of the other places that Mr Litvinenko visited that day.

Professor Dombey estimated that at least 50 micrograms of polonium 210 was put into the teapot at the Millennium Hotel on the afternoon of 1 November 2006. His reasoning was that the 4.4GBq that Mr Litvinenko was considered to have ingested equated to 26.5 micrograms, and the higher figure of 50 micrograms was chosen as a conservative estimate to allow for the extra polonium 210 that had been in the teapot but which Mr Litvinenko had not ingested, i.e. the polonium 210 mixed with the unpoured tea in the pot and the undrunk tea in the cup.

)

Neither Mr Lugovoy nor, in the end, Mr Kovtun, gave oral evidence to the Inquiry. However, both have made public statements concerning the case since 2006 and Mr Kovtun provided the Inquiry with a witness statement.
Mr Kovtun told a German newspaper in December 2006 (i.e. a few weeks after the meeting in the Pine Bar) that he did not have a clear memory of the meeting and that at the time he had paid more attention to his cigar. More than eight years later, the statement that he provided to the Inquiry contained a detailed account of the meeting, including an assertion that Mr Litvinenko “grabbed the teapot on the table and, without waiting for an invitation, poured himself some tea” and that he “gulped down two cups of hot tea one after the other … [and] then had a coughing fit” (see paragraphs 6.318 – 6.319). There is no reason at all to think that Mr Kovtun’s memory had improved dramatically so many years after the event. The only logical conclusion is that he was lying on one or other (or both) of the two occasions.
The deficiencies in the accounts that have been provided by Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun, of which the matters set out above are only examples, lead to two conclusions. First,I do not regard the evidence that the two men have given about these events as credible, and I will not accept any part of their accounts in the absence of corroboration from a reliable source of evidence. Second, and more importantly, I make a positive finding that **both men have deliberately attempted to mislead** the recipients of the various accounts they have given regarding crucial issues in the case. I infer that they have done so in order to conceal their own actions. These findings support my **overall conclusion that Mr Lugovoy and Mr Kovtun poisoned** Mr Litvinenko.

## Scenes of contamination
Various sites were identified as having been contaminated in the days and weeks following Mr Litvinenko’s death – hotel rooms, restaurants, aircraft, offices. Detective Inspector (DI) Mascall said that the task that faced the police and the forensic scientists in this respect was unprecedented, certainly in the United Kingdom (UK). In the course of his evidence he explained the system of sequential testing that was adopted involving the police, scientists from the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) and scientists from the Health Protection Agency (HPA).
